`emit(options: EmitOptions): Promise<Stats[]>`

The function takes the `EmitOptions` object as an argument, which includes the following properties:

- `locales` - A [CompiledLocales](types.mdx#compiledlocales-type) object.
- `outputPath` - The path to the directory where the files will be written.
- `clear` [optional] - A boolean value indicating whether to clear the output directory before writing files. The default value is `false`.

The function returns a promise that resolves to an array of [Stats](types.mdx#stats-type) objects.
