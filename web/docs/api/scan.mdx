# scan

**Scan the specified directory for localization files.**

`scan (options: ScanOptions): Promise<LocaleFile[]>`

The function takes the `ScanOptions` object as an argument, which includes the following properties:

- `path` - The path to the directory to scan
- `matcher` - A [Matcher](types.mdx#matcher-type) function for filtering the files to be scanned.
- `recursive` [optional] - A boolean value indicating whether to scan subdirectories recursively. The default value is `true`.

The function returns a promise that resolves to an array of [LocaleFile](types.mdx#localefile-type) objects
