# CLI

You can use the CLI to compile translation files.

There is only one available command: `compile [options] <output>`.

It requires one argument:

- `output`: the directory where the translation files will be generated.

Additionally, there are several options:

- `input <value>`: the input directory where the tool will search for translation files. The default value is the current working directory.
- `clear`: clears the output directory before compiling the translation files. The default value is `false`.
- `watch`: watches for changes in the input directory and recompiles the translation files. Only use this option during development. The default value is `false`.
- `recursive`: searches for translation files recursively. The default value is `true`.
- `merge`: allows having the same namespace in different files. This is not recommended. The default value is `false`.
- `help`: displays the help for the command.

For example:

```bash
npx i18n-collector run locales --input src --clear --watch
```

The above command will compile translation files into the `./locales` directory and watch for changes to `*.locale.json` files in the `./src` directory.
The `./locales` directory will be cleared before compiling translation files.
